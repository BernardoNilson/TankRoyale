# Tank Royale 

Robocode is a programming game where the goal is to code a bot in the form of a virtual tank to compete against other bots in a virtual battle arena. The player is the programmer of the bot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write a program for the brain of the bot. The program is telling how the bot must behave and react to events occurring in the battle arena.

The game is designed to help you learn how to program and improve your programming skills and have fun while doing it. Robocode is also useful when studying or improving machine learning in a fast-running real-time game.
